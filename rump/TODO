	$NetBSD: TODO,v 1.1 2007/09/10 21:18:55 pooka Exp $

* fix the build structure to work better on non-NetBSD
* finish fs/bin/fsconsole
  + figure out how to handle mount parameters in fs-independent
    fashion (requires kernel changes)
* compile more components directly out of the kernel source tree
  + whole of vfs_subr?
  + kern_lock?
* support ltsleep + locking primitives which might need to sleep
  (only lfs needs this currently)
* support nfs
